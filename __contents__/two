## Day two: OAuth and you

### Why Q.all did not work yesterday

We did not have a:

`var Q = require('q')` 

anywhere in our index.js file, so it was failing to find the Q object at all

### Getting Started

First, please pull down class notes from [yesterday](https://github.com/mottaquikarim/AdvancedJavaScriptWorkshopGA).

You will find a folder called __oauth__, that is where we will start our work today.

### Creating a GitHub App

Please go [here](https://github.com/settings/developers) and create a new application
Then, go [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and create a new personal token

### Wiring up routes to handle OAuth

1. What is OAuth anyways?
2. Look [here](https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/) to get a sense of how we have to implement OAuth for GitHub
