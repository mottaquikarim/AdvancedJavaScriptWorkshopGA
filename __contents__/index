# Hello, Wrold!

Welcome to General Assembly.

## Game Plan for today

In this class, we will cover the basics of working with NodeJS. 

### Day 1
We will dabble in FileI/O in Node, how to write command line scripts, and how to use NodeJS to generate scaffolding for new websites.
Finally, we will begin the process of creating our very own simple static site generator.

### Day 2
We will create simple HTTP servers in node JS and move on to using express to generate websites. 
Mainly, we will stick to creating API driven NodeJS backends powered by express.
Additionally, we will learn how we can use Node's CommoJS module loading pattern on the frontend and how to interface with the API we built with expressjs.
